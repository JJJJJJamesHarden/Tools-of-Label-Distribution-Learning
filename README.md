When you agree to the above items，I will introduce this repository and how to use it.
This repository contains tools for Label Distribution Learning.
You can use these tools to learn the Label Distribution model ,mark prediction and conduct comparative experiment.
This repository contains eight label distribution learning algorithms,
they are ：
AA-BP,AA-KNN,BFGS-LLD,IIS-LLD,PT-Bayes,PT-SVM (Please refer to the paper "Geng X, Ji R. Label distribution learning").
CPNN  (Please refer to the paper "Yin C, Geng X. Facial age estimation by conditional probability neural network").
MSVR  (Please refer to the paper "Tuia D, Verrelst J, Alonso L, et al. Multioutput support vector regression for remote 
sensing biophysical parameter estimation").
